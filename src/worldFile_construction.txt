Other world files are text files (.txt), they contain a series of node type blocks,
up to 2^32 node types can be included, they are delimited by an empty line,
they do not need to appear in order.

a node type uses this format:

string: type name
integer 0 to 100: red, green, blue
0 to 2^32 replacement rules

The first node type must be called "world", node types are delimited by at least one blank line.

replacement rules use this format:

| (up/left: split direction) (integer 1 to 99: split percent) (node type name) (node type name)

The integers can be as is to be a proportion of the parent,
or have the following units (um, mm, cm, m, km), such as 50cm.
